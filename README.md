implements the FHP-1 LGCA model(2 body and symmetric 3 body collisions)
This simulation took ~2hours for 4000 timesteps on a Dell Inspiron machine with 4 GB RAM
In keeping the code as readable as possible, efficiency may have been compromised. Feel free to make edits to speed up computation
Bits and pieces of code were taken from several sources on the internet
